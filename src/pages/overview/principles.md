Capital design system enables OpenGov teams to build best-in-class government applications. The system is built and maintained by the OpenGov R&D team. It offers React components, design guidelines, and interaction patterns.

**We believe to be successful, it should adhere to the following principles:**

<Grid>
  <div>
    <h3>Quality</h3>
    As the base of all OpenGov applications, it is important that the system meets the highest standards of quality.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Flexible</h3>
    The system bends to the needs of the applications and fits all use cases.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Understandable</h3>
    Patterns and code are easy to understand and intepret by anyone.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Efficient</h3>
    The system supports the efficient design and development of OpenGov applications.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Comprehensive</h3>
    Covers many use cases and needs
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Consistent</h3>
    Guidelines, patterns, components / props are written and structured consistently throughout system
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Encapsulated</h3>
    You donâ€™t need to understand the detailed inner workings of the system to use it
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Poly-morphic</h3>
    Pieces be reassembled as needed to fit different applications and systems
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Shared</h3>
    Managed by one core team but treated as a shared resource that everyone uses and contributes to
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Compositional</h3>
    Pieces can be built one on top of another to assemble one larger structure, rather than having a large structure that is configurable
  </div>
</Grid>
