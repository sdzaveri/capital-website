Benton Sans aligns perfectly with the traits, tone and requirements of the system.

### Benton Sans Characteristics

<Grid columns="four">
  <div>
    <h4>Credible</h4>
    Benton feels credible – especially its numbers. One PM with a background in finance said, “These look like an accountant’s numbers.”
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Relatable</h4>
    Even though the face is refined and reserved, it has an organic quality and subtle variations. It avoids feeling severe and and moves toward a humanist tone of voice, the perfect balance for OpenGov.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Flexible</h4>
    Benton offers most of the flexibility that OpenGov requires. Some features that make it especially suited for OpenGov: multiple widths, weight duplexing, and tabular figures.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Classic</h4>
    With roots in the classic typeface News Gothic, Benton feels universal and established.
