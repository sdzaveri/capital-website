# The thinking behind the color system

## Tailored for data visualization
Expressed through this palette, data visualizations feel both sophisticated and credible. Visualizations are more easily understood and fulfill accessible requirements. They’re beautiful, to boot.

## A color to match every customer need
With a total of 210 distinct colors, this palette supports the color customization needs of OpenGov customers. Aligning color with a customer’s brand palette helps users “speak” to colleagues and citizens with one voice.

## Cool and complex
This palette is soothing, with an emphasis on cool tones. It’s predominantly a triadic color scheme (green, blue, purple) with OpenGov’s blue at the center. Hues are complex – never “straight from the tube”. Dignified.

*BONUS:* most organizations have cool brand colors, so emphasis on cool hues means it’s easier to match a customer’s brand color.
